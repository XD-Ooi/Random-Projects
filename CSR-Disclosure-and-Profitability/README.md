# CSR Disclosure and Profitability

For this project, I ran multiple linear regression models to determine the relationship between CSR Disclsoure and Profitability among Chinese publicly listed firms.

Specifically, I ran the two following regression models:
* ROA = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1CSR + 𝛽2age + 𝛽3state-ownership + 𝛽4total-asset + 𝛽5debt-equity-ratio + e; and
* ROE = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1CSR + 𝛽2age + 𝛽3state-ownership + 𝛽4total-asset + 𝛽5debt-equity-ratio + e; and
* EPS = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1CSR + 𝛽2age + 𝛽3state-ownership + 𝛽4total-asset + 𝛽5debt-equity-ratio + e; and
* NPM = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1CSR + 𝛽2age + 𝛽3state-ownership + 𝛽4total-asset + 𝛽5debt-equity-ratio + e; and

The data for this project was extracted from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database.
