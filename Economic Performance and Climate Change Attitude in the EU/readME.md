# The Effect of Economic Performance on Climate Change Attitude and Action in the EU

This is an econometrics project for my course in *Economics in the EU*. 

For this project, I ran some multiple linear regression model to determine the relationship between several macroeconomic indicators and European citizens' climate change attitude and action.

Specifically, I ran the two following regression models:
* attitude= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1f_to_m + 𝛽2unemployment_log + 𝛽3gdp_pc_log + 𝛽4cpi + 𝛽5public_debt_log + e; and
* action= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1f_to_m + 𝛽2unemployment_log + 𝛽3gdp_pc_log + 𝛽4cpi + 𝛽5public_debt_log + e.

The data for this project was extracted from OECD, Eurostat, World Bank, and the European Commission’s biannual Special Eurobarometer reports.
