# The Effect of Economic Performance on Climate Change Attitude and Action in the EU

This is an econometrics project for my course in *Economics in the EU*. 

For this project, I ran some multiple linear regression model to determine the relationship between several macroeconomic indicators and European citizens' climate change attitude and action.

Specifically, I ran the two following regression models:
* climate_attitude= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1sex_ratio + 𝛽2unemployment_rate + 𝛽3gdp_per_capita + 𝛽4cpi + 𝛽5public_debt_per_gdp + e; and
* climate_action= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1sex_ratio + 𝛽2unemployment_rate + 𝛽3gdp_per_capita + 𝛽4cpi + 𝛽5public_debt_per_gdp + e.

The data for this project was extracted from OECD, Eurostat, World Bank, and the European Commission’s biannual Special Eurobarometer reports on Climate Change.
