# What Affects the Financial Performance of a Country

This is an econometrics project for my course in *Introduction to Econometrics*. 

For this project, I ran some multiple linear regression model to determine the relationship between several macroeconomic indicators and countries' fiscal balance.

1. balance_per_gdp = $\beta_{0}$ + $\beta_{1}$gdp_pc_log + $\beta_{2}$tot + $\beta_{3}$unemployment_log + $\beta_{4}$year_2017 + $\varepsilon$ (under stricter independent variable correlation threshold);

2. balance_per_gdp = $\beta_{0}$ + $\beta_{1}$gdp_pc_log + $\beta_{2}$gross_savings + $\beta_{3}$tot + $\beta_{4}$unemployment_log + $\beta_{5}$year_2017 + $\varepsilon$.

The data for this project was extracted from World Bank's database.
