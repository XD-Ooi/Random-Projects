# What Affects the Financial Performance of a Country

This is an econometrics project for my course in *Introduction to Econometrics*. 

For this project, I ran some multiple linear regression model to determine the relationship between several macroeconomic indicators and countries' fiscal balance.

* balance_per_gdp = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1gdp_pc_log + 𝛽2tot + 𝛽3unemployment_log +𝛽4year_2017 + e (under stricter independent variable correlation threshold);

* balance_per_gdp = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1gdp_pc_log + 𝛽2gross_savings + 𝛽3tot + 𝛽4unemployment_log + 𝛽5year_2017 + e.

The data for this project was extracted from World Bank's database.
